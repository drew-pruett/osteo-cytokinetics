  14% of body weight is skeleton.
   in a 70 kg man, this is ~10 kg.
   then Ca is 10% of skeleton weight.
   Assuming all mineralized tissue is hydroxyapatite, then 9% of skeleton weight is phosphate.
   without that assumption, it is safe to assume that 10% of skeleton weight is PO4
   if 'clasts resorb 300 mg of calcium per day, they resorb 3 g of bone per day.
   in one year, this is ~1.09 kg, corresponding to ~10 kg ion 10 years, i.e. total remodeling in 10 years.

   so 200 ng of activatable(?) TGFbeta are released each day from bone, i.e. .1389 ng/min.
   This is released in the resorption space.
   Assume it is all bound in the resorption space.
   NEED VOLUME OF RESORPTION SPACE TO DETERMINE ACTIVE CONCENTRATION. 
   ALSO NEED BLOOD FLOW PER BMU PER MINUTE TO DETERINE WASHOUT AND NONLOCAL CONTRIBUTION
   If we assume there is no non-local contribution of TGFbeta to developing bone, this means that the BMU are secreting .1389 ng/min of
